            <h1>
                Hi, I'm <u><strong>Adrien Blandin</strong></u>
            </h1>

            <p>
                I'm a part-time CTO in Lyon (France) <strong>looking for exciting new missions</strong>. 
            </p>

            <p>
                If you are in one of the following situations, we should schedule an appointment together:

                <ul>
                    <li>You're running a start-up company and need help setting up the technical architecture of your projects and the team that will manage them</li>
                    <li>You're at the head of an already-structured company that has lost its CTO and needs someone to handle the transition period</li>
                    <li>You're part of an already structured company and are looking for a fresh look at your organization to challenge and improve it</li>
                    <li>You are part of an already structured company and are looking for someone to oversee the start-up of a new project or team</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                For 4 years I built and managed a team that grew from 3 to 30 people, including product, design, infrastructure, backend, frontend and data, through all the company's periods of hypergrowth, right up to its successful IPO. I'll be happy to tell you how I can help your business grow through the use of technology.
            </p>

            <h2>Pricing</h2>

            <p>
                I work 4/5 days (the last day is dedicated to my personal tasks) for a daily rate of <strong>€800</strong>. Each month's work must be paid in advance to avoid non-payment.
            </p>

            <h2>My manifesto</h2>

            <p>
                As a technical team leader, my main objective is to build a working environment where teams are as efficient as possible (while being happy) to help the company achieve its objectives. I'm not interested in technique "for technique's sake"; its sole raison d'être is to serve the business.
                
                <br><br>
                
                This has forged several convictions that sum up my approach:
                
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        I'm not looking to change people, but systems. I place great emphasis on the Developer Experience through two crucial questions: 

                        <ul>
                            <li>Where do we lose time in the development process?</li>
                            <li>What can we do to stop wasting time?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        At the heart of the Developer Experience lies the question of the health of the code base. A healthy code base can drastically reduce development times for every feature that is requested. To achieve this, the quality of the work carried out is a fundamental issue, and I impose on myself and the team a rigorous and demanding approach.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        To reduce technical debt and future legacy, I work with a personal (and often controversial) concept I call "extra effort". This consists in having a technically long-term vision to bring additional context to each feature design. The aim is to think about what we're going to do tomorrow, so we don't get bogged down with today's issues. This means investing 10% more time today to save 50% tomorrow.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        To maintain maximum efficiency, I try to keep the technical stack (and its diversity) as simple and less diverse as possible, even if this may be perceived as "boring". I place a strong emphasis on the reusability of existing work to meet multiple needs.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <h2>Knowing myself better</h2>

            <p>
                I've been interviewed several times on prestigious podcasts, in which I've had the opportunity to go into more detail about the way I think and work:

                <ul>

                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>Previous experiences</h2>

            <p>
                I worked as Chief Technical Officer at <a href="https://lepermislibre.fr" target="_blank">Lepermislibre</a> and Backend Software Engineer at <a href="https://dougs.fr" target="_blank">Dougs</a>, CanalMatch (co-founded), <a href="https://batch.com" target="_blank">Batch</a> and Ottercamp (co-founded).
            </p>

            <p>
                When I'm not helping build apps people love to use, I spend most of my time hiking, cycling and sleeping in the wild.
