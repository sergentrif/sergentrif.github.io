        </h1>

        <p>
            As a technical team leader, my main objective is to build a working environment where teams are as efficient as possible to help the company achieve its objectives. I'm not interested in technique "for technique's sake"; its sole raison d'Ãªtre is to serve the business.
            
            <br><br>
            
            This has forged several convictions that sum up my approach:
            
            <br><br>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    1. I'm not looking to change people, but systems. I place great emphasis on the Developer Experience through two crucial questions: 

                    <ul>
                        <li>Where do we lose time in the development process?</li>
                        <li>What can we do to stop wasting time?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    2. At the heart of the Developer Experience lies the question of the health of the code base. A healthy code base can drastically reduce development times for every feature that is requested. To achieve this, the quality of the work carried out is a fundamental issue, and I impose on myself and the team a rigorous and demanding approach.
                </li>

                <li>
                    3. To reduce technical debt and future legacy, I work with a personal (and often controversial) concept I call "extra effort". This consists in having a technically long-term vision to bring additional context to each feature design. The aim is to think about what we're going to do tomorrow, so we don't get bogged down with today's issues. This means investing 10% more time today to save 50% tomorrow.
                </li>

                <li>
                    4. To maintain maximum efficiency, I try to keep the technical stack (and its diversity) as simple and less diverse as possible, even if this may be perceived as "boring". I place a strong emphasis on the reusability of existing work to meet multiple needs.
                </li>
            </ul>

            I previously worked as Chief Technical Officer at <a href="https://lepermislibre.fr" target="_blank">Lepermislibre</a> and Backend Software Engineer at Ottercamp (co-founded), <a href="https://batch.com" target="_blank">Batch</a> , CanalMatch (co-founded) then <a href="https://dougs.fr" target="_blank">Dougs</a>.

            When I'm not helping build apps people love to use, I spend most of my time hiking, cycling and sleeping in the wild.
